A left rotation operation on an array shifts each of the array's elements  unit to the left. For example, if  left rotations are performed on array , then the array would become .

Given an array  of  integers and a number, , perform  left rotations on the array. Return the updated array to be printed as a single line of space-separated integers.

Function Description

Complete the function rotLeft in the editor below. It should return the resulting array of integers.

rotLeft has the following parameter(s):

An array of integers .
An integer , the number of rotations.
Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers  and , the size of  and the number of left rotations you must perform.
The second line contains  space-separated integers .

Constraints

Output Format

Print a single line of  space-separated integers denoting the final state of the array after performing  left rotations.

Sample Input

5 4
1 2 3 4 5
Sample Output

5 1 2 3 4
Explanation

When we perform  left rotations, the array undergoes the following sequence of changes:


"""


import math
import os
import random
import re
import sys

# Complete the rotLeft function below.
def rotLeft(a, d):
    num_of_rotations = d % len(a)
    b = a[num_of_rotations:]
    for num in a[0:num_of_rotations]:
        b.append(num)
    return b


if __name__ == '__main__':
    fptr = open(os.environ['OUTPUT_PATH'], 'w')

    nd = input().split()

    n = int(nd[0])

    d = int(nd[1])

    a = list(map(int, input().rstrip().split()))

    result = rotLeft(a, d)

    fptr.write(' '.join(map(str, result)))
    fptr.write('\n')

    fptr.close()
